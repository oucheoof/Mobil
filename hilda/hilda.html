            <h3>The Global Village</h3>
            <p>At the end of the 20th century, we began using portable phones. When the portable phone was invented, it
                changed our way of communicating. We started being able to communicate wherever we were.

                The portability of the mobile phone gave us the ability to communicate anytime, anywhere. Suddenly, we
                could take our calls wherever we went.

                When the portable phone arrived, it began reshaping the work life in several ways. People were no longer
                tied to their desks or workplaces in the same way as before. Now, there were new possibilities to work
                outside the office.

                The portable phone makes us constantly available and enables us to communicate constantly.

                Socially, it changed how we kept in touch with each other. With the ability to call and send messages
                from any location, distances became less significant. We could share moments and experiences instantly,
                whether it was through calls, pictures, or messages. The portable phone has shrunk our world. The
                distance between us has decreased, and people can feel closer to each other than ever before.

                McLuhan formulated the concept of "The Global Village," describing how technology reduces distances
                between people and how the world has become more interconnected. We are now constantly connected and can
                communicate over great distances in an instant.</p>

            <p>Technological advancement in accessibility has witnessed a profound evolution, particularly concerning
                user interaction. The early stages of accessibility were notably simplistic, a far cry from the
                sophistication of today's smartphones. The transition from the first iterations to modern smartphones
                represents a monumental leap.
                <br>
                <br>
                Accessibility was initially straightforward, but with the advent of smartphones, complexity soared. The
                ease of use became a pivotal concern. Economically and socially, the landscape shifted dramatically. In
                earlier times, the acquisition of these devices posed a significant financial hurdle, limiting ownership
                to a select few. The cost was prohibitive, and widespread ownership was a luxury.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, the demographics of phone ownership evolved. Initially, it was predominantly business-oriented
                individuals who owned phones. Yet, today's landscape depicts a stark contrast. The prevalence of phone
                ownership, especially among the younger demographic, underscores a societal shift. Phones are no longer
                exclusive to business circles; they are ubiquitous across various demographics, transcending age and
                occupation
